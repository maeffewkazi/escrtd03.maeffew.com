It was immediately apparent that we needed to search for an entirely new ingredient to color the glass so we began consulting with different companies across the globe. However, in the end, it was our internal solution that turned out to be the best one. It was a fusion of knowledge based on our centuries-old tradition and modern-day technological innovation. This is really how it works. I have been in the glassmaking business and collecting glass-coloring recipes since 1987. In my office, I have dozens of different combinations that make different colors.

Selecting ingredients is always a long process and we prefer to work with our suppliers on a long-term basis; however, the main ingredient is the same for all crystals, including our cadmium-free Red Velvet, which is our naturally silicon-rich Bohemian sand that has always been and will continue to be sourced here.",slogan:"ON SOURCING THE FINEST INGREDIENTS FOR RED VELVET..."},martinaKohlbergerovaBerkova:{id:"3",slug:"martina-kohlbergerova-berkova",position:"top",about:"A SINGLE COMBINATION OF INGREDIENTS CAN ACHIEVE UP TO FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT SHADES – IT TAKES GREAT CARE AND FINESSE TO ACHIEVE THE PERFECT COLOR AND CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT.",name:"Martina Kohlbergerová-Berková",skills:"Research Specialist \n20 years at Preciosa",perex:"My favorite part of working with crystals is playing with the color palettes. You can achieve five or six shades within a single combination of ingredients. It’s just about finding the perfect one. Every day we control the shades and consistency of the colors.

Red Velvet’s unfinished material was so well made that we experienced not a single issue while working with it. Each of our polishing processes is closely supervised, as we believe experience is the key to achieving the highest quality. Even the most technologically advanced instruments need to be monitored and adjusted by the supervising glassmaker if you’re expecting premium quality.
